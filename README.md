## Bugs and Feature Requests

All bugs and feature requests should be submitted by opening a Github [issue](https://github.com/bricefrisco/NamesLoL/issues).  
These can be opened to request a new feature, or to report a current feature that is unavailable.

## Installation

Pull down the code, run `npm install` then `npm start`.  
By default, the `.env` file specifies the NamesLoL API. This is okay to do, as the CORS policy is open.  
If you are also running the [backend](https://github.com/bricefrisco/NamesLoL), then modify the `.env` file to point to your API gateway.  
That's it! You can now develop and test locally.
