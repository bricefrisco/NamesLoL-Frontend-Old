## Bugs and Feature Requests
All bugs and feature requests should be submitted by opening a Github [issue](https://github.com/bricefrisco/NamesLoL/issues).  
These can be opened to request a new feature, or to report a current feature that is unavailable.

## Installation
Pull down the code, run `npm install` then `npm start`.  
By default, the `.env` file specifies the NamesLoL API. This is okay to do, as the CORS policy is open.  
If you are also running the [backend](https://github.com/bricefrisco/NamesLoL), then modify the `.env` file to point to your API gateway.  
That's it! You can now develop and test locally.

## Deployment
For deployment, first you must create an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/acocunt/sign-up)  
Run `npm install -g serverless`, and `serverless login`.  
Set up [IAM credentials](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials#:~:text=Follow%20these%20steps%20to%20create,Framework%2C%20like%20serverless%2Dadmin%20.)
in AWS with admin access, then run `serverless config credentials`. 

To deploy to a development environment, run `serverless deploy`.  
To deploy to production, run `serverless deploy --stage prod`.  
That it! Keep an eye out in the console for the URL to the web app.  
The URL can also be found in the [Serverless App](https://app.serverless.com)
